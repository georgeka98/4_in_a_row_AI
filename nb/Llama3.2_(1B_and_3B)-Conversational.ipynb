Yesterday, I was waiting for my first appointment with a new psychiatrist who is supposed to help me with my anxiety. The clinic I was in also has a couple of family GPs, so there were a couple of young kids in the waiting room with their parents, who were mostly quiet. I was sitting in a corner listening to music with my headphones, when in walks this woman with her 5 small children. She sits down right across from me and starts texting or something on her phone. I\\'m only half paying attention, but through my music I can hear whining. I ignore it, close my eyes and pretend to sleep. A few minutes later, my headphones are pulled out of my ears. One of the little devils has my phone in her hand and is putting her sticky hand all over it. Without thinking or saying anything, I grab it back out of her hands. Bad move. She starts screaming. \"I WANNA PLAY A GAME! LET ME PLAY!\" I\\'m a little shocked. I say \"No.\" I\\'m not sure what else to say.

And then, \"All she wants to do is play on your phone! You goddamn racist!\" (They were black.) At this point, people are starting to stare at me.

So like all tifus this didn\\'t happen today but in June when one of my best friends got married. He tasked me with the job of music at the reception, just computer to speaker stuff, this was a simple affair, no DJ or band. Both me and the groom are huge ASOIAF/ GoT nerds. For some lulz I decide to prank the best man, a mutual friend, by interrupting his toast with the song \"The Rains of Castamere\", which is a song from the show. Spoilers ahead, ye be warned. This song is a dirge commemorating a character\\'s ruthless extermination of his enemies. During a wedding in season 3 there is a massacre of the guests orchestrated by this character, and the song is used as the cue to start the bloodshed. In this scene several important characters die in a shocking and gruesome hail of crossbows at the wedding feast. So I decided to play this song at my friends wedding reception. The groom thought it was hilarious, he turned red laughing, and the best man proceeded to go his best Walder Frey impersonation. Most of the guests were just confused. The bride on the other hand became inconsolably distraught and angry. She, in between sobs, demanded I leave, while trying to explain to her dumbstruck parents why she was so upset and why the song was so awful. I later learned that red wedding scene caused her to pass out a few years ago when it first aired. The groom does his best to console her while failing to hold back fits of laughter. I was asked to leave by the in laws. Now, months later, the bride won\\'t speak to me and has done her level best to end me and the groom\\'s friendship.

After cleaning up as much as he could, Ralph went to the boss and ratted my dad out saying he was poisoned by him.

Many people are requesting for a system to get the BOT to drop their weapon, much similar to how interacting with them causes them to drop the bomb. The flaw with a system like this would be that when a player leaves, the BOT gets their own pool of money, separate from the player who disconnected, starting from $800 and building up. The BOT uses this money to buy utility and weapons for itself. Now here is the problem; currently, when the player who disconnected re-joins, he \"destroys\" the BOT\\'s money pool and its items, and the reconnected player starts with basic pistol, and the money he would have received in the rounds that he missed. This means that with the requested system you could make the BOT drop his weapon, and if the player re-joins within a certain time you would effectively have a free weapon from the BOT\\'s cash pile, plus the reconnected player will be able to buy one of their own. This has potential to be exploited for extra weapons, since you will have 6 players worth of economy indirectly. The only way I can see round this is only letting BOTs drop weapons they have picked up, but this still allows an effective extra weapon to be carried when the player re-joins. If anyone has another solution to this problem, please comment, as it would be nice to see some other opinions on this problem! It would otherwise be a great feature to the game, since you may control a BOT and want to save a weapon, which you cannot access currently unless you die yourself.

We tell her to make sure she\\'s in neutral and not touching the brakes or steering wheel. \"I\\'m not stupid. I know how to go through a car wash.\" Her car jumps the rollers again, except this time we\\'re watching and see her brake lights come on as soon as the rollers start moving her.

She was one of those people that comes to a complete stop before turning her wheel to turn in somewhere. I always knew she was coming in because I could hear people on the street honking at her. I would always meet her car before she got to where she needed to be because I didn\\'t want her to drive anymore. One time she refused to get out and wanted to drive her car through the wash herself. I was standing down the lot and directing her on where to go. She hits the gas, hits me, I flip over the top of her car, land on the concrete, watch her jump the curb(as she hits a shopping cart that flies so fast it sticks in a wooden fence), go into the lot next door and do a donut, and hop back over the curb and crash into the side of our building. We had to share an ambulance. She was 90 years old and her kids weren\\'t keeping her from driving or watching over her. She was holding the gas in the whole time, thinking it was the brake. Out of all that time she didn\\'t think that maybe she\\'s not pressing the brake.', \"Hi there.

So I had probably my most out of body trip this past weekend. This was on Saturday and I wanted to write about it right away but needed some time to reflect due to, Holy fucking shit, what happened? DOSE: 39.8 grams fresh Cubensis, I grown my own and have been isolating strains for a few months now, Current strain is definitely stronger than any I have eaten before. 1.5 dry (equivalent) gives decent visuals and will make you forget what the fuck is happening for 4-5 hours easily. My usual dose is 25-30 grams. I haven\\'t tried my dry shrooms yet since I always have fresh supply on hand and its much better, I have a ton of dry stuff but havent tried any yet. Just gave away about 50 grams dry to my friends and neighbors this week since I have been sitting on full quart ziplock bag for about a month, and used another 30 grams dry to make chocolates which I\\'ll save for later. Mono-tub grows FTW! TRIP REPORT: So I had planned to trip on Saturday, Nothing special no friends or anyone tripping with me. Usually I just enjoy listening to music and go for walks outside or to the nearby lake ( still a 3 1/2 mile walk but not going to drive there so no options). I was in a pretty good mood and physicked for the trip, as I usually am. If I don\\'t feel right or am not in a good mood I\\'ll just wait until later and throw my harvest on the dehydrator. I picked what had grown that past week, my usual 30 grams, but that left just one big mushroom on the surface so I figure \" cant leave this guy here on his own,\" So i picked him and a few aborted baby shrooms also. By the time the substrate was barren my scales tipped 39 grams. Whatever, I\\'m down for this. So I ate the first half straight up and quickly assembled the rest into a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which i also ate. I laid down and put on some tunes. Tame Impala filled my room and my mind as I was absorbed into the comfort of my bed. It was a warm morning so my window fan was blowing a cool stream of air over me. After about 25 minutes the sensation of the air started to change and become more like being absorbed in a wave. There were pulses of warmth and of cool which felt like they lifted and lowered my body. I was still very much consciously present, and was enjoying this feeling with a huge grin on my face and occasionally laughing when the air came in really fast. At this point I realized I was soon to be tripping hard and should grab a quick snack so my empty stomach doesn\\'t feel all weird and nauseated during the trip. I grabbed a bag of Cheetos from my snack cupboard and knew I was already tripping hard because the cheetos bag and all the other snacks looked like they were laughing with me when I opened the cupboard. I actually got quite frightened and closed it, but when I opened it again the laughing oreos and giggling snickers bars were thankfully inanimate. I sat down and opened the cheetos bag. The crunching sound of the bag was very loud and displeasing, it sounded aggresive. So I set the bag down and tried to remove cheetos without disrupting the bag. I plucked out one cheeto and placed it in my mouth. Here\\'s where shit got real. I bit down on the cheeto and was flooded with the cheezy flavor. It was the best cheeto I\\'ve ever tasted. It was the best thing I have ever tasted, hands down. I could feel my heart rate racing and my breathing became very eratic, like after climbing 4+ flights of stairs but not like after a hard run. Next, I could feel a powerfull euphoria over my body. I lay down imediatly as my field of vision narrowed. I closed my eyes and was no more. I had not felt like I had died, but my body was no longer part of what I would describe as me. I had become just the construct of cheesy taste and had no beginning or end. Nor did my cheesyness occupy any space. Suddenly, I was reborn as a Cheeto. I was re-incarnated as a cheeto with only the purpose of becoming and maturing into the best, cheesiest, awesome, cheeto ever to be consumed. I lived the life of a child cheeto with cheeto parents who instilled great values of honor and pride into me. I dedicated myself to physical fitness, learning, schooling, and competing against other cheetos to prove my prestige as the best cheeto to ever exist. Now that I relfect on this this whole part of the trip is most definetly a direct parody of my life, I was raised to always strive to improve and be the best I could be. I am currently in college for engineering and am doing well in the top 10 % of my class, have an excelent job for the summer, and recently got into being a bit of a health nut and have improved my diet and been hitting the gym. Anyway, I (still the cheeto) continued in my life of success. I had moments of faliure such as trying to find a female cheeto to love, and being rejected, ( also a parallel with my life ) but turned this into my strength as I built a stronger network of like minded ( also single, lol ) cheetos who would become my best friends and partners in our quest to be cheesy cheetos. Towards the end of my cheeto life, I and my friends and family were chosen for the final task for which we had spent preparing our whole lives, We were grouped and bagged into a plastic tomb where we would be sealed until it became our time to prove our worth. After what felt like an eternity of nothingness I ( still in cheeto form ) saw bright light, and a powerful hand of god reached down and took me, I was hoisted towards the mouth of myself ( my human form ), and could think only of how happy I was that I had made it, I had reached my goals, and proved my self worth. During the last seconds of my existence as a conscious cheeto I felt powerful euphoria and the feeling of understanding \"why\". No \"why\" in particular but all \"why\\'s?\" ever asked. Everything was clear. Everything was calm. This feeling was exactly what I had described earlier with the air from the fan coming into my room, The feelings of cheeto euphoria and human euphoria slowly melded together and became indistinguishable. At this point I realized I was back to my human self and looked around to explore my surroundings and confirm I was indeed a human and not a cheeto. Although I didn\\'t particularly care either way, If I had opened my eyes and realized I was still a cheeto this would have been o.k with me. The memory\\'s were very strong at this time and I could remember a lot more details than I can now, whereas now it feels like a distant dream. I went on to do many other things during my trip which were also fun and cool (didn\\'t eat any more cheetos from the bag as once I realized what had happened I was afraid it would happen again and I didn\\'t want to risk it), and I enjoyed the trip as much as any other time I\\'ve been tripping. But this out of body experience was by far the centerpoint of the whole ordeal as it felt completely and eerily natural. TLDR, ( Ate shrooms, Wasn\\'t peaking yet and was hungry, Grabbed bag of cheetos to eat, Ate one cheeto, Started peaking, Died, was reborn as a Cheeto into a cheeto society where I conquested to become the best cheeto in all of history, ate myself, died, was returned to my body, was like \"Whoa dude\", Didn\\'t eat any more cheetos, Still have an open bag of cheetos with only eaten from the bag laying in my room. )', \"This is amazing.

A few years back (summer after our second year of university) a buddy and I were at a party in a rural university town about an hour outside of the city where we grew up. It was a fairly big party and there were tons of people there, including a few guys my buddy played football against. Everything was going well, it was getting late, and my girlfriend came to pick me up, so I took off. About fifteen minutes later I got the phone call: things had turned ugly after I left, and someone sucker-punched my buddy. The way he fell, he fractured his skull, had to be evac\\'d by helicopter to the city, where he underwent hours and hours of surgery. The next year or two was a brutal, brutal recovery period. At first they weren\\'t sure if he\\'d ever be able to play sports again, much less a concussive sport like football. Against all odds, he trained his ass off, and was back on the field a year and a half later, for his fourth year of eligibility. That fourth year, his school (a different rural university town outside of the city) had homecoming. At their homecoming game, they played against the team that rostered the guy who had hit him (let\\'s call him Punchy for clarity\\'s sake.) Anyway, my buddy\\'s team shitstomped Punchy\\'s team all afternoon, and ended up winning by a few touchdowns, with a particularly gifted performance by my buddy. Later in the night, we were at the bar (THE bar, not A bar) drinking like fish and celebrating a big win, and ultimately, his return to being successful at football. Later in the evening, we look up, and who should come swaggering over to the table but Punchy and a couple of his boys. Me and my buddy both stood up, along with one of the D-linemen on his team, ready for whatever. After the usual macho back-and-forth shit-talking between the athletes, Punchy leaned in with a smirk and asked my buddy \"how\\'s your head?\" Without even missing a beat, I swear to God, my buddy took a quick crowhop forward and HEADBUTTED Punchy square in the face. We heard a crack, and Punchy immediately hit the floor and began leaking blood. The rest of the night predictably turned to shit, but before the chaos ensued, my buddy stood over Punchy and replied \"you tell me.\" May not be the wittiest comeback I\\'ve ever heard of, but it was damn sure the most effective.', 'British man attempts to rob Warsaw bank using a drawing of a pistol.', 'I read somewhere it was made like that so that people can be seen doing graffiti, drugs, and other things they should not be doing in public bathrooms.', 'Ireland It actually has urban areas as well as green landscapes and castles We have WiFi and Broadband and all that modern stuff We really do drink a lot in general.

So, I don't know how to post the story after I made the OP so I'll put it here for all to see and if someone lets me know the right way to do it, I'll move it. We rented a beach house with a path through the sand dunes to the beach. I was told on multiple occasions by the homeowner that the small space we planned to use was semi-private (private isolated area between two public beaches) and does not require a permit for weddings. There have been 13 other weddings at that location without issue. I also tried to research permit requirements on that beach to do my due diligence and found nothing that required it for that area. The ceremony was only 22 people (mainly family) so they all helped with set up. I was getting ready so was not part of the set up. My helpers informed me later that they saw the PO ride by on his ATV multiple times and he said nothing. It was clear that it was a wedding with white chairs lined up and an arch with white fabric wrapped around it. He also saw me walking the path to the ceremony, before the ceremony began, in my wedding dress. There were multiple occasions to ask about our permit. When he pulled up on his ATV it was loud and not discreet so I turned around to see what was happening and he then asked me if we had a permit (instead of discreetly asking a guest since there were no ushers/planners). I told him it was semi-private beach and that I was told I didn't need a permit. He kept repeating that I needed a permit. Family members started chiming in and being sassy and I asked them all to be quiet and asked him if he could please let us finish and it would only be 15 minutes. He hesitated and I told him I'd be happy to give him my information and pay whatever fine we needed to (assuming I got wrong information and we needed a permit). He hesitated again and I pleaded again for him to please let us finish. He finally relented and just left. Afterwards as we were taking pictures, another PO drove by and I asked 'are we okay to take pictures, the ceremony is over?' He said 'oh yeah no problem, take your time' and was not concerned about our lack of permit. I talked to the vacation home owner afterwards and he was shocked to find out this happened. He again assured me 13 weddings have taken place there without permit because it was semi-private beach and asked for the PO's info. I'm contacting the city to determine if indeed a permit was needed so I can inform the homeowner either way. If it wasn't needed, I'll report the PO so he is aware of the beach boundaries in the future. I was the least upset about the situation, family members were more angry than I was. I think it's a funny story to add flavor to our wedding. However, in retrospect, he could have found another opportunity to ask about the permit than after the ceremony began and could have handled it better in general. I don't mind that he asked, which is within his job duties, but he could have also been respectful about it. He also had a pretty shitty grin the during the encounter that made me feel like it was a power play.

He is very annoying as you can see,\" the man said as I squirmed in the chair. The scent of blood was trapped in my throat by the thick band of tape wrapped around my face. An opening scarcely more than a slit by my nose caused my breath to come in thin wheezes, further inhibited by the liquid caking the inside of my broken nose. Letting out a brief whimper, I heard him sigh again at the noise. \"You see chat I mean?\" he addressed the invisible audience, \"I think ve should get on and crush it.\" *He couldn\\'t be serious.* From somewhere above me, the machinery rose in pitch, a high whine cutting across the rumble of the motors, and I knew what was descending upon me. At first first contact my hair was flattened against my head, the pressure then increasing on my scalp as my head was pushed downwards. The force increased and my chin collided my my chest, straining the muscles in my spine. I was hunched over further and the press continued downwards, forcing my chest into my knees and stretching my shoulders away from my hands which had been tied behind the chair. And still the push became stronger. I felt the first vertebrae pop somewhere in my lower back, directly below the column. Crying out in muffled agony, a ripple of cracks arched up my spine and my legs went numb as I felt my abdomen turn warm, a wet rush inside me as my pelvis compressed. My legs splayed out to one side as I continued to scream, my entire body now on fire as my brain struggled to interpret the signals it was receiving. I tugged at myself and something slopped onto the floor below. Through the clouds I saw a pile of string sausages linked together.

About 15 minutes later along comes a kid, looks around, hops on the bike and pedals away. As he passes my bush and slows down I jumped out of the bush and yelled 'HEY THAT'S MY BIKE!' about a foot from his ear. Kid started panic pedaling into traffic and tried to hit the brakes on the street. He got hit by a car. I waited for the ambulance then went home.

She asked me why I left and I told her a little. She challenged me to reread the BOM blah blah blah. The biggest thing I took away from that conversation was this.

Isn't my mental health just as important? I didn't take leaving the church lightly. Anyways i just thought it was interesting.

Initially there was G, PG, and R. Movies could be rated X, but that just meant that the MPAA refused to rate the movie, or that the filmmakers declined to have it rated by the MPAA. Because of that, anyone could use the X rating, which is why X-rated movies became associated with porn. G used to actually mean movies that didn\\'t have any objectionable material. Star Trek: The Motion Picture, for example, was rated G, even though it had some scary moments like the transporter accident. R was reserved for movies that actually were for adults. Movies with sex (although not explicit), or language, or excessive gore. And PG was supposed to be somewhat in between. You could get away with a little nudity, violence, and a bad word here or there, and parents were supposed to take this into account when deciding whether or not their children should see the movie. But of course, people being what they are, somehow thought \"Parental Guidance\" meant \"Do my parenting for me\" and when movies like Temple of Doom pushed the envelope of what a PG movie could be, they insisted that a new rating be made. And that called that PGWRMITTNSYSLYT (Parental Guidance We Really Mean It This Time No Seriously Don\\'t Let Your Kid Watch), which was really hard to remember so they shortened it to PG-13 because the second part had 13 words in it.

It was the most horrifying item of clothing I think I've ever seen.\", 'I\\'ve had just the opposite. I was the custodian. (Cleaning man?) When I was in college, every winter break I would go to the temp agency and they would place you in all types of temporary jobs. Some were temporary construction where you\\'d only go in for a day. Some you have for weeks or the entire month break because they needed someone immediately and couldn\\'t find a full time replacement. Anyway, this one winter I was given a custodial job in an office park, basically emptying trash and doing minor cleanups in each office. It was great because I didn\\'t start until 530ish and could finish by 930 or 10 and go out for the night and then sleep in. Generally I didn\\'t run into any people, as most people were gone for the night. But in one office for the first 3 nights of work I notice this beautiful lady, probably in her mid to late 30s, all alone, deep into her spreadsheets at 8pm. At first I would just knock, apologize for bothering her, change out her garbage, and wish her a good night. After I noticed her being in the office late every night I would walk in, crack some corny jokes, comment on the pictures she displayed in her office, and lamely tried to flirt, fumbling through my words. I suppose this became endearing and by the end of the second week she would seem to be relieved to see me, offering her a chance to take a break and relax for a moment. One day as I\\'m reaching for her garbage pail, she grabbed my biceps and said \"not too bad\" and laughed. I laughed and shook my head, thinking she was just messing with me (I\\'m very normal/average build) but couldn\\'t help imagining in my 20 year old brain that this possible meaned something. The next night, she\\'s the only person in the office again at 8 and she\\'s dressed like it\\'s straight out of a porno in an office setting. Tight pencil skirt, heels, a tight button down blouse, and glasses (which she didn\\'t wear every night). I decided that after yesterday I was okay to shoot my shot so I commented that her outfit was really working for her. She smiled at me and unbuttoned one more button and asked \"does it look better like this? Or that\" as she re-buttoned the button. Without missing a beat, I replied \"did you try unbuttoning 2 more buttons?\". For some reason this makes her crack up and she stands up, approaches me, and slaps me on the chest...but then she unbuttons 2 more buttons, gets closer, and starts rubbing my chest then starts to kiss me then pulls back. She then pushes me and tells me to sit her chair. She unbuttons her shirt completely, revealing her bra, and proceeds to get on her knees and unbuckle my pants. She blows me for maybe 90 seconds total and my head is spinning and I\\'m done. Then she looked up at me and laughed, buttoned her self back up and said \"go on and get out of here\". I got to the bar that night and my friends drinks were on me. The next night when I walked in, I say my hello, and she proceeds to direct me steP by step exactly what I needed to do and exactly how I was going to fuck her. The first night she told me she was going to bend over the the desk, the next night she explained that she would be laying with her back on the desk and I would be finishing on her chest, the night after that she told me to sit in her chair and she would ride me. Every night for those next two weeks was slightly different but with her directing every single aspect of it. To be honest I had never experienced anything like that and it was hot as hell. For those 20 mins each night, she was completely in control of everything and it really got her off. I let her know when it was my last day and that I would be driving back to college the next afternoon. She told to pick her up on her lunch break and she blew me while I drive around town before dropping her off. I can\\'t say any experiences that next semester in college lived up to it.

Yes, its a little weird maybe, but strangers don\\'t know, and its not actually harmful to anyone). The the comments started. I am happily with my bf [23m] of over 4 years currently in a long distance relationship (we got into two different grad schools). My brother has started making comments about how he \"is not my boyfriend.\" For example, I say \\'I like your shirt,\\' he says \\'I\\'m not your boyfriend.\\' And its all the time. No matter what I say its \"im not [my bfs name]\" or \"im not your bf!\" Next came the clothing issue. Headed to the dentist brother was driving me so I wouldnt have to drive afterwards. I am running late, he is already in the car, I run out and hop in. He looks at me, turns off the car, and goes back inside that house without a word. He comes back in a different shirt. I ask him surprised why he needed to change shirts. He says \"we were wearing the same color.\" That was over a month ago, and since then he has changed clothes 6 times if we have had on the same color. I dont mean the same shirt, I mean like anywhere on the entirety of the blue spectrum. Anything that is similar. Then tonight for dinner, the reason for this post, is that my family was sitting down to eat -at home- and everyone was already seated. He comes around the corner, sees the only empty chair is next to me, and immediately turns around and walks to the other side of the table and stands behind my sister. TO EAT DINNER. Mom finally tells him to stop being dumb and sit down, but he makes a big production of moving the chair over as far as possible. I need some sort of advice. This is driving me crazy.

The reasons for this are that it is bulky, expensive, and I never get any pictures of myself. It ends up just ends up me taking photos of other people and its just not that fun for me. My last vacation with my ex-girlfriend, all I had for it was selfies that I took with my own phone. I told my girlfriend this that I don't want to take my camera and explained to her all the reasons. She says that she gets it but that if I loved her that I would bring the camera and we wouldn't have to use it all the time. I told her that I just rather not. She has been really upset about this, and said that I did it for my ex-girlfriend why can't I do the same for her. I told her that I learned my lesson from my ex-girlfriend and I don't want to bring it.

I told her none of that is true, but she doesn't believe me. This has basically soured our relationship, the trip she was really excited about now she is upset about it.

Of course I knew this was complete bullshit. First I asked how she even met this woman, because I was a cocky little shit in middle school and I always had to be right. Weeaboo-chan over here says they met on a forum discussing Inuyasha, which was also obviously bullshit but hey, it was a good shot.

What are some of your favorite things that players have said as part of an adventure or gaming session, which sort of turned into a running gag or meme?

Straight ahead at the end of the hall is a single door (locked, behind which is their main target, a Red Wizard that they are trying to track down and capture). * Newer PC#1: Which way, do you think? The double door or the single door at the end of the hall? * Newer PC#2: I don\\'t know. Double door means \"boss fight\" to me, so I think the single door first. * PC#1: Hmmm, true, but this corridor has been linear, so that may be the end, too. It\\'s also a dead end. * PC#2: True. Hmmm. * PC#1: Honey, which way do you think we should go? Double door or single door? * Experienced PC#3: Which one is straight ahead? * PC#1: The single door. * PC#3: Let\\'s check inside the double door first.

And now everyone is so disgusted by all the hate TSM got. If you play bad you get flamed bad, just deal with it. Other teams at least didn't pretend to be hot sh1t. All was hyped by fans, nor Froggen nor any other ALL player said that they will crush everyone (reddit created hype themselves and when it didn't happen - blame others), but what they got was even worse than what TSM is getting.

They said they can do it, but honestly, I haven't seen anyone to prefer TSM over SKT or EDG, just wishful and pitiful NA personas (hoping that trashing NA means something in context of international strenght). TSM had best chance ever to finish top 2, but it still was far-fetched. And at last. I wish for trashtalking segments. Good trashtalking, not TSM-like.

The bull 'rapes' the cow when she is on heat. In my opinion as a cow expert, the cow is unaffected by the process in which she gets pregnant. Separating the calf from the mother is sometimes tricky. As humans, we put human feelings onto animals. So we think the cow is feeling how a human would feel if the same happened to them. This is not true IMO. The cow realises she has no longer got the calf with her. Some cows immediately carry on with their life and forget instantly. Others have the natural maternal instinct to look for their calf or call for it for a short while. Then they too forget and concentrate on other things like looking for food.

Maybe I'm alone in this echo chamber here, but I have been seeing a lot of posts recently claiming that Trump is the next libertarian candidate, and I've got to say, its crazy how many people believe this joke. The guy is a total authoritarian who will pander to literally every crowd to try to get votes. Not one word he says is believable. He's pro patriot act, pro NSA, pro overzealous military spending, interventionism, and anti-individual rights, wanting to block specific groups of people based solely on race and religion. I understand a lot of people in this sub probably feel the pull to find a candidate to support in the general election. They want someone that won't fuck them over fiscally. Well, I've got news for you, and you're not gonna want to hear it, but here it is; **You're fucked regardless of which party gets elected.** Whether it be Bernie, Hillary, Trump, Cruz, or Rubio, every single one is going to expand the budget, take away your 4th amendment rights, attack internet freedoms, expand the role of the executive branch, and all around be a pain in your ass. Me, I'm done with their bullshit. I have been for a long time. I'll do what I did in '08 and in '12 after Paul dropped out, and I will protest vote the presidential election for the Libertarian party in all likelihood. What is probably more important at this point is for us to start identifying our most promising State legislators who will fight Washington tooth and nail, and be sure to get them elected. The fight for presidency is just a fight to be head puppeteer. For the time being, they still need congress and the house to get things done, and if we can organize enough support in those two places, maybe we can finally fight back against executive branch encroachment. Thomas Massie, Justin Amash, Rand Paul, they all need more help! They need more people backing them, more congress(wo)men, more senators to help push back against overbearing federal legislation. We have become too shortsighted, as we always do come presidential election season. Lets keep our eyes on the prize, and continue pushing forth candidates that are honest and consistent, and who are true role models for liberty.

The Giant is what we will be focusing on today. **STEP 2** When looking for a game make sure the team-mates you find are Prestige 4 or above, if not leave the lobby and look again. It doesn't matter about your own level because you know you are good. **STEP 3** When you first start in a multiplayer game make sure to show you are better than everyone else by killing as many zombies as possible. Sticking to one window is for wimps so make sure to spam grenades to get maximum kills and assert yourself as the Alpha male. **STEP 4** Do not open any doors, you are killing most of the zombies so why should you open any doors?! Buy the RK5 and carry on killing then nominate a person without a mic and tell them to open the way to the most important part of the map the mystery box **STEP 5** Now that your useless teamates have opened the doors to the mystery box now is time to use all of your points until you get a Ray gun, this is the best gun on zombies because you only the to PAP it once instead of twice and ignore TURNED because you want to kill zombies not become their friends. Once you have a Ray gun hopefully you will come across a Sniper which will come in handy in the later steps. **STEP 6** Catwalk time, again if your team-mates have opened the way to the catwalk and turned the power on this is where you will stay. Unfortunatley the XBox one version has now had the Skill jump patched so you have to stay in the corner of the Catwalk instead of outside the caged area. When the rest of your team choose to run to you for safety this is where you will look out of the window and shoot zombies with your sniper, dont look inside the building as that is your team-mates job. If you get hit in the corner carry on shooting down the courtyard whilst yelling at your team-mates to do their job's properly. **STEP 7** Now you wait here until dogs, hopefully you will have enough points to PAP. You don't need Juggernog as long as your team are doing its job, when there is one dog left go and PAP. If any team members get downed make sure to leave them to show them they need to improve. If a glitch happens while getting back to the catwalk and Treyarch downs you make sure to yell down the mic to your team mates for not doing their jobs yet again. **STEP 8** If you get downed past level 15 then leave, if you are downed it shows that your team is not good enough and do not deserve to play with you.

He had 54 hours of play time and I had just gotten to the Shinra building. Needless to say, he was pissed. His standard punishment at the time was to make us kneel in a corner, facing a wall, with our hands on our heads. He couldn't actually see the corner he chose because the couch was in the way, but he was sitting in the room watching TV, so I couldn't leave. I was only supposed to be there for a half hour or so, but, unfortunately for me, he fell asleep while watching TV. After kneeling there for awhile, I also fell asleep leaning against the wall. When my dad woke up, he completely forgot that he never let me out of the corner. About 6 or so hours later, I woke up and my legs hurt really bad from kneeling on the cold floor for so long. So, I'm crying and asking my dad if I could get up yet. Well, my parents start freaking out because they didn't even know I was there. I had no feeling in my legs, so I had trouble walking for a bit.

Hey, this just happened so I apologise in advance if I come off as a bit salty/upset. For some context, I\\'m living out of home and am in my first year of university; scraping by and working my arse off. I make ends meet and I have a modest income, but not really any expendable income; and sometimes find myself with no money available to me at all; but with no outstanding costs until my next pay check. (I can\\'t go on benefits because my parents\\' income is too high, yet they won\\'t offer financial assistance themselves. Not really relevant but just setting the scene). My friend, let\\'s call him T, however is a professional soccer player, and has a 60k+ income that he will often throw on roulette or something like that. He\\'s an old friend of mine from when we were 6, and I see him semi-regularly. My other friend, C; is just average. Both live at home and thus have expendable incomes (especially in the case of T). T invited me around this evening for some video games and kicking back, which I was keen for; seeing as it was catching up yet with no cost attached. When I\\'m about to leave; he texts me and says that there\\'s been a change of plan; that we\\'re going out for dinner at this semi-expensive restaurant and that he\\'d love for me to come. I initially decline, saying that I can\\'t afford it and that I\\'d catch up with them after. However; he begins to go \"oh, but C has trekked it all the way from X\" and insists that I come along; saying that he\\'s shouting (paying for) the feed anyway. After he pesters me some more, I cave and say I\\'ll be there. The dinner goes pretty well! Some banter, good food, and overall I thought it was a good time. That was until we got to the end of the meal. T suddenly looks panicked and looks in his wallet. \"Oh shit, I don\\'t have my card with me\". He then goes on to show me that he\\'s got enough in cash to pay for his section of the meal, and C has enough to pay for his, but then begins to laugh at me and begin giggling at my expense because \"you\\'re up shit creek mate, too poor to pay for your own meal\". Then goes on to laugh about the fact that I\\'ll either have to dine and dash (which I\\'m not comfortable with and honestly would never do) or that I\\'m straight up fucked. The whole time I\\'m trying to kind of laugh it off as banter but as he persists with his insistence that he doesn\\'t have enough to pay for me; I get more and more uncomfortable and pretty upset. He then begins to jokingly call the waiter over for the check, and says that there\\'s an issue. I excuse myself to go to the bathroom to try and get some fresh air and maybe try and work out what the fuck is going on; and when I return they\\'ve paid for their individual shares, and have apparently told the waiter that I can\\'t pay for mine. Manager comes up and says he\\'ll have to call the police, all while my friends have walked out of the restaurant. Just before he rings, however; my friend comes back and says he\\'ll pay for me, and that he has to bail me out ONCE AGAIN (I\\'ve never taken a cent of his money before, I make a point of being self sufficient and not taking bail outs.) So after I was humiliated at a restaurant I actually quite like and sometimes go to with my family (and that I can never go to again); T begins to just spend the rest of the time laughing at my expense and about how great that display of \"banter\" was. I\\'m pretty fucking steamed so I just kind of walk off and haven\\'t replied to his texts. Banter is one thing, but public humiliation like that... It just seems a bit much. Am I overreacting and need to get some thicker skin? Was I just an idiot to think my loaded friend just wanted to be generous, or should I have seen it coming?

The cooldowns for Toys seem rather arbitrarily implemented, without any concern for what the toy actually does. Gamon\\'s Braid has a 2-hour cooldown, Iron Boot Flask has a 1-hour cooldown. I looked back through previous posts but none of them really seem helpful. \"It ruins the flavor of WoW if you can just spam them constantly.\" Makes little sense depending on how long you play. If a *majority* of people play for 5+ hours a day, then alright, I could see limiting the use of Toys. But some of them just have baffling CDs for no real reason. Hell, Moroes\\' Famous Polish is debatably more \"game-changing\" than either of the above because it shows your character as being as naked as possible, but it only has a 30 minute CD by comparison. Spirit of Bashiok summons the dancing tree that\\'s on fire for like 3-5 minutes, but has an hour CD, whereas Archmage Vargoth\\'s Spare Staff has a 2 minute cooldown and lasts around the same time as far as I\\'m aware. Even if the items all cause strain on the servers, which I\\'m sure they do when spammed (Like the Haunted Memento\\'s ghost thing apparently), that doesn\\'t change the inconsistency with regards to the cooldowns. How is the cooldown decided? Orb of Deception lets you change into a member of the Horde for 5 minutes with a 30-minute CD. Iron Boot Flask makes you an Iron Dwarf for 10 minutes with an hour CD.

Here\\'s the thing about that - **Only a court can state with definitive authority that a crime was committed**. A police officer can *suspect* that a crime was committed (detaining and investigating a suspect), and a police officer can *allege* that a crime was committed (arresting, charging and presenting a case to a court), but until that person has been convicted in court, the question of what crime was committed is irrelevant, because no one else has the authority to answer that.

All the ground vehicles need a traction tweak, including the harasser who was messed up during the flash update, but the biggest and most frustrating thing I find while driving a tank is sliding down hills. As soon as you turn sideways on a hill you start sliding as if the ground underneath you got a Paula Deen treatment. It makes navigating hills that should be possible to navigate impossible because there may be one section where you have to turn to get around a rock or something and boom, Slidestone National Park. Tanks don't slide...ever. They especially don't slide while sideways. But currently you can go faster in your tank by turning sideways and sliding down than if you pointed nose down and hit the throttle as hard as you can. Sliding down hills has caused enough tank flips(which is ridiculous on it's own), tanks getting stuck, or tanks getting put in hostile areas and blown up, to make me want to rip out my hair. This needs to be addressed. I am not a programmer so I won't tell you how or say it's an easy fix, but the traction factor for sideways movement needs to be increased dramatically.

If they approved, they would sign their initials next to the box we checked off. We kept the first page, and the teacher got the next two carbon-copy pages. For some reason, I decided I wanted to be in AP English. My heart was set on this, but, alas, my English teacher was a bitch and wanted to crush my soul in every way she could. She didn\\'t like me, and I had asked her about AP English before only to be shot down. AP was for her favorites, of which I was not. I knew if I brought my packet up to her with the \\'AP English\" box checked, she wouldn\\'t initial it and I would end up stuck in the general (CP) English class next year.

I marked CP on the white page, brought it up to bitch teacher, and she initialed with no questions asked, although I\\'m sure she was so satisfied in that moment. God she was a bitch. She proceeded to separate the copies, smugly. I got my white copy, and the other two went in the box to be filed or whatever the fuck they do with them.

She made no clear point that yes, she would like to be my first definitely if I was just patient. She even in the past tried to get me to date or hook up with other girls, to encourage me to do it.

And then, when she got (understandably) upset, instead of staying and working it out, you went and left for the night, leaving her home with the kids by herself while you pay for a hotel room. Does the hotel room cost more money than the pizza night would have? Probably. How much money are you spending now on cigarettes? Look, as someone who has moved to a different country, I get it. It is incredibly stressful to uproot your life and move somewhere where you don't know anyone. But you've only been there for a couple weeks, so you are both likely still going through culture shock.

But you and your wife need to be a team, and you need to sit down together and budget, and make it through this together. You can't just run away every time there is an issue. If she has to stay home watching the children while you go to work each way, I guarantee you she feels even MORE isolated than you do. At least you have work to go to, with built in interaction with others, and a support network. Unless she can reach out and find other ex-pats and other mom groups or something, the only person she has is you, so of course she reacted badly when you wanted to cancel the dinner plans that she was probably looking forward to all week.

Long story short my husband and his sister have never gotten along, like ever. At Christmas she wanted to come see the baby. My husband responded that was fine but in order to do so he would like to discuss how she has mistreated him in the past few years to get it all out, come to a mutual understanding and be in each others lifes. Well she would rather act like nothing has ever happened and move on. Which in reality means, keep acting like she always has and we get treated like crap. So because of that, he told her she could not visit and she was not welcome. Fast forward to last week. I send out pictures and videos of the baby every month to family and friends so that they can see the baby grow up and what not. His sister has never been included in these due to her actions. Well my husband asked his mom if she had been sending those to his sister. After beating around the bush, she finally admits that she has. My husband was fuming. He asked her if she could respect his wishes and not send them to her since she is not a part of our life, to which she responds \" can you respect me?\" This was after he told her that he was on the brink of a nervous break down. What mother reacts that way? Your son tells you he\\'s pretty much depressed and you don\\'t seem to give a shit. My husband has done so much for his mom. He paid her bills when she got divorced and couldn\\'t afford them. Completely ran her reception when she got married again, and has been there for her so many times. She continues to treat me, him, and even my family with complete disrespect. But oh wait it gets better. He tells her that if she wants to keep acting like this then there is no reason for her to come up this weekend. 20 minutes later we get an e mail. She informs us that she has a fast growing tumor on her uterus and is going to have a biopsy and hysterectomy. Way to throw a guilt trip on your son. My husband responds and says that he\\'s sorry and that he hopes that they can get this resolved quickly and that he will always be there for her, but also that he feels very hurt how his feelings are always pushed to the side and treated like they don\\'t matter. Needless to say I didn\\'t have to deal with her this weekend, yay! However this is far from over. I hate seeing my husband so upset when all he wants is to feel loved and respected from his own family. We\\'ve been together 8 years and this is how he always gets treated. And if he sticks up for himself he\\'s still the bad guy.

Nonetheless with a knowing look and a smile he poured us a pint each. About half way through this first pint a group of men walked into the bar and the whole atmosphere changed. It was clear these men were highly respected within this community. We decided to sidle on up to them and start a conversation. They took a liking to us and started buying us drinks. My memory fades rather abruptly at this point, next thing I remember is waking up on a boat. It turns out these men worked on a trawler. We got far to drunk and the men didn't know what to do with us, so they took us out on their boat for the day. Me and my friend tried to make our selves useful, but it was clear we had no idea what we were doing, much to the amusement of the trawler-men. Suddenly a quiet fear settled over the boat. We were heading right for a storm, and the captain, a haggard seaman of many years was scared. Told us later it was the worst storm he'd ever seen. Sure enough a wave came crashing into the side of the boat. We gathered ourselves up and looked around and my friend was nowhere to be seen. He'd been washed overboard by the wave. The captain flew out of his cabin, quickly tying a rope around his waste he dove into the water. There was a moments calm as everyone anxiously waited. A few bubbles floated to the surface. Then we a triumphant splash both captain and friend surfaced. The rest of the crewe dragged them both back on board. Without saying a word, the captain walks over to a pile of oysters and with a flick of his knife opens one up and hands it to the nearest man. It's clear what he is doing, we survived and we are toasting that fact. Since we don't have beer an oyster shall have to suffice. We raised our oysters and downed them in unison and they just weren't for me really...\", \"Gurkhas man, you don't fuck with Gurkhas.\", 'Oct 10th, 1993 - \"Rapist of the Month\" campaign at Oberlin college puts a random male student\\'s name attached to an image declaring them a rapist.
