For those who don't know me, I **LOVE** zero-sum games. These include chess, connect 4, reversi, tic tac toe etc. Sometimes I could end up playing chess for hours as I did when I was young.

As soon as I started learning about game theory, my interest of those games sparked, so I started applying my knowledge on building AI opponents on those games.

To simplify things, connect-4 is a 4x4 board and the AI opponent is unbeatable. I used the minimax with alpha beta pruning to make the AI opponent. In the future, I want to expand this by adding heuristics and make the board larger (the standard 7x6).
